# Automated Host Discovery And Vulnerability Scanning

The Greenbone Vulnerability Manager is a great tool for IT and Blue Teamers to manage devices, scan for vulnerabilities, and issue patch tickets all in one. So, I wrote a script for a quick and easy host discovery and scan queing. 

I also made a script to view the results of the scan, but it's much easier to view in the Web GUI. The discover_and_scan.py script, however, is much faster at discovering devices and starting a scan.
